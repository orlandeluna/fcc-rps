New attempt at the Rock Paper Scissors Game.

This time I'm following the freeCodeCamp Tutorial, mostly to understand
the way other programmers do things and expand my knowledge.

Personally, I want to do it myself, but everytime I see a new approach to the
project, I discover more ways to do it, which is interesting.

Afeter this is finishied, I'll try to continue the one I have from The Odin Project.
